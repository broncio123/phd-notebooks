GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, VERSION 5.0.6
Executable:   /cm/shared/apps/Gromacs-5.0.6/install_gcc/bin/gmx_mpi
Library dir:  /cm/shared/apps/Gromacs-5.0.6/install_gcc/share/gromacs/top
Command line:
  mdrun_mpi -s mdf/em.tpr -deffnm mdf/confout_bil_test


Back Off! I just backed up mdf/confout_bil_test.log to mdf/#confout_bil_test.log.3#

Number of hardware threads detected (16) does not match the number reported by OpenMP (1).
Consider setting the launch configuration manually!
Reading file mdf/em.tpr, VERSION 5.0.6 (single precision)
Using 16 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process
Compiled SIMD instructions: AVX_256 (Gromacs could use AVX2_256 on this machine, which is better)

Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity

Back Off! I just backed up mdf/confout_bil_test.trr to mdf/#confout_bil_test.trr.3#

Back Off! I just backed up mdf/confout_bil_test.edr to mdf/#confout_bil_test.edr.3#

Steepest Descents:
   Tolerance (Fmax)   =  2.00000e+02
   Number of steps    =          200

Energy minimization reached the maximum number of steps before the forces
reached the requested precision Fmax < 200.

writing lowest energy coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up mdf/confout_bil_test.gro to mdf/#confout_bil_test.gro.3#

Steepest Descents did not converge to Fmax < 200 in 201 steps.
Potential Energy  = -1.7436191e+06
Maximum force     =  2.0763227e+04 on atom 25462
Norm of force     =  1.6039186e+02

NOTE: 7 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      17 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
